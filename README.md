# Guess-The-Number-Game
Learning to code in Java, this is my first project, where I'm learning how to create a number-guessing game. The user will have to keep guessing a number the computer is thinking of until the user gets it right

Open the Folder NumberGuessingGame followed by the "src" folder, and you will see the code right there.

Now, I could have added a while loop to ask the user if they want to play again, regardless of whether they won or lost the number guessing game.
But my issue with that is that I would have to restructure the whole code, and I didn't want to do that because:

1. I am too lazy to do that if I'm being honest.
2. I am just trying to learn the basics of Java, so I wasn't planning to make it perfect.

For your information, I have used AI for the sole purpose of helping me and guiding me through when I was particularly stuck or when I didn't know how to write something specifically and when I needed to debug. To clarify, I did not use AI to copy and paste code.
